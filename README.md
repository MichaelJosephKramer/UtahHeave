## Rules

![Utah Heave Arena](https://github.com/MichaelJosephKramer/UtahHeave/images/UtahHeave.jpg "Utah Heave Arena")

The first rule of Utah Heave is you DO NOT TALK ABOUT UTAH HEAVE! (Tweeting about it is
acceptable.)

Rule 2: A Utah Heave game will consist of two rounds of play. Total combined score from
the two rounds determines the game winner.

Rule 3: All point value shots must be attempted per round.

1. The point value shots may be attempted in any order.
2. The five point shot must be taken last in the round.

Rule 4: Any throw that hits the table disqualifies the player for the game.

Rule 5: Heave Off - In the event of a tie for first place following two rounds of play, there will be a Heave Off.

1. Heave Off starts with each competitor taking a 5 point shot. If there is no
    winner, then each competitor will take a 5 points shot and a 4 point shot. If there
    is no winner then the shot progression continues to include the 3 point shot, and
    finally the 2 point shot.
2. There is no 1 point shot in a Heave Off.
3. The shots can be taken in any order.
4. The 5 point shot is not required to be last in the Heave Off.

### Special Scoring

**The Kaufman:** Should a player score only their one point throws in each round, thus
resulting in a total game score of two, that player will have achieved The Kaufman.

**The Eaton:** Should a player score only their one point throw in one round, and
score zero points in the other round, thus resulting in a total game score of one, that
player will have achieved The Eaton.
